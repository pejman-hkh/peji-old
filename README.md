# Peji framework
Mini php framework

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/pejman-hkh/peji.git
```


# Why Peji

- Simple & fast in run and develop
- We don't use php array and instead we use php function callback ( php array cause slow speed )
- We don't use template engin ( don't need to waste time for learn new syntax and compile template engin to php ...)
- Real mvc ( We implement Peji as mvc and you don't waste time for implement your mvc )
- Dynamic route ( you don't need to write route for each controller )

```
composer install
```

Edit config/db.php

Enjoy it !
